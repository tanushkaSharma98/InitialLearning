        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is widely used for building robust, secure, and platform-independent applications. Its official documentation provides detailed information about its syntax, core libraries, and best practices, making it easier for developers to learn and implement Java effectively in real-world projects.</p>

        <h2>About topic</h2>
       <p>Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It allows developers to write code once and run it anywhere, thanks to the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Java supports multithreading, garbage collection, and strong memory management, making it robust and secure for large-scale applications.</p>
        <p>Java code is first compiled into bytecode by the Java compiler (`javac`). This bytecode is then executed by the JVM, which is platform-independent. The language enforces strict syntax and typing rules, uses packages for modularization, and follows OOP principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. Developers typically use build tools like Maven or Gradle to manage dependencies and compilation.</p>
        <p>Java integrates with other technologies and languages in various ways. For instance, it can call native code using Java Native Interface (JNI), interact with databases via JDBC, and consume or expose web services using REST APIs or SOAP. Java also works alongside frontend technologies through frameworks like Spring Boot (backend) combined with Angular or React (frontend), enabling full-stack development.</p>
